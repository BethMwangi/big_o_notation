Big O references how **complex** an algorithm is.
Big O is the way of measuring the efficiency of an algorithm and how well it scales based on the size of the dataset.
let's say you have 20 items and you want to sort them out. One can use alot of algorithms to sort them out, however not all algorithms are built equally. 
Some algorithms are more complex than others.
This is where the big O comes in.Since it measures the worst case senarios and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
Efficiency covers the following;
 *CPU (time) usage
 *Disk usage
 *Memory usage
 *Network usage

###Types of Algorithic Complexities(running time)

#####Constant Complexity Order of One
This means that the size of the data is irrelevant, the algorithm will always take a constant time. 1 item takes 1 second, 10 items takes 1 second, 100 items takes 1 second.Â It always takes the same amount of time.In short it takes the same amount of time regardless of the amount or size of the data.running time is denoted by O(1).
#####Logarithmic Complexity
#####Linear Complexity
#####Qadratic Complexity
#####Cubic Complexity
#####Exponential Complexity
