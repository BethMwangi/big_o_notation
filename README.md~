Big O references how **complex** an algorithm is.
Big O is the way of measuring the efficiency of an algorithm and how well it scales based on the size of the dataset.
let's say you have 20 items and you want to sort them out. One can use alot of algorithms to sort them out, however not all algorithms are built equally. 
Some algorithms are more complex than others.
